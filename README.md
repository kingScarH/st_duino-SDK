# STDuino SDK – Bare Metal ARM Made Easy 

> A custom SDK developed from scratch for STM32F4xx microcontrollers.
> No HAL. No CMSIS. Just pure control and performance.

###  Why STDuino?

STDuino bridges the gap between Arduino simplicity and ARM power.  
It brings beginner-friendly APIs like `pinMode()`, `digitalWrite()` and even advanced ones like `pinModeAF()` for alternate function pin configuration.

  Designed for:
- School & college students
- Arduino hobbyists
- Makers switching to STM32
- Engineers tired of HAL bloat
- For professionals
- Rapid prototyping

###  Highlights

- Written 100% from scratch using only STM32F411RE datasheet
- Ultra-lightweight SDK (no HAL, no CMSIS clutter)
- Arduino-style APIs for fast prototyping
- Layered architecture (GPIO, UART, Timer, ADC, systick  NVIC_Interuupts etc.)
- Easily portable to other STM32 boards

###  Code Policy

This repository contains only usage examples (e.g. LED Blink, Moisture Sensor, External Interrupts).  
**The full SDK source code is not publicly shared.**  
It is protected under a custom license and can be provided upon request under a licensing/teaching agreement.

###  Want Access?

If you're an educator, developer, or student interested in using STDuino SDK for your project,  
reach out via GitHub or email. I’d be happy to teach, license, or collaborate.


##  Future Modules & Roadmap (Work in Progress)

 - SPI
 - I2c
 - DMA
